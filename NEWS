Changes in version 0.9.4 (2015-06-05)
Bugfixes

Changes in version 0.9.8
Bugfixes
  * Fix extraneous warning from dir.create call within lazyRepo when dir already exists
  * When specifying a package in switchrDontUnload, its (recursive) dependencies are now included also.

  * empty calls to ManifestRow now correctly return an empty (0 row) manifest df, rather than a df with 1 row filled with NAs
  * crandb related methods (rVersionManifest and cranPkgVersManifest) now return SessionManifests rather than PkgManifests with tarball sources.

Minor API changes
  * SessionManifest now defaults to defining a cohort of 0 specified package versions on top of the specified package manifest
  * Added head and tail methods for PkgManifest and SessionManifest objects
  * makeBiocSVNURL and related functions will now accept "devel" or "trunk" to indicate the current devel version. Default is now "devel" 
New features

Changes in version 0.9.10 (2015-07-01)
Bugfixes
	* Fix regression(?) where specifying a SessionManifest seed for an existing library would force it to rebuild and reinstall everything in the seed.
	* Calling switchTo with a seed for  library that already exists now invokes a message rather than a warning

Changes in version 0.9.11 (2015-07-06)
Miscellaneous

Miscellaneous
	* Remove unnecessary usage of globalVariable to increase compatability with old R versions
