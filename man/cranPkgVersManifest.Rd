version of a CRAN package and versions of its (recursive) dependencies

version resided on CRAN}

}
\arguments{
\item{pkg}{The package on which to base the generated manifest}

\item{vers}{The version of \code{pkg} to construct the cohort around. Note
this must match the the version string exactly, i.e. 1.3.1 and 1.3-1 are
*not* equivalent.}

\item{earliest}{Should the package dependencies be contemporary with the
first (TRUE) or last (FALSE) day the specified package version was
(the latest version) on CRAN?}

\item{cur_avail}{The output from available.packages(). Used to identify
whether the necessary version is in the CRAN archive or normal repository}

\item{verbose}{Should debugging information about the recursive traversal of
package dependencies be printed (defaults to FALSE).}

\item{suggests}{Which Suggests'ed packages should be included. Currently
supported possibilites are direct, indicating Suggestions of \code{pkg}
should be included, and none, indicating that no Suggests'ed packages
should be counted.}

\item{delay}{Number of seconds to delay between successive REST calls
to the crandb database. Defaults to 1 second}

\description{
cranPkgVersManifest
Create a Pkg manifest which points to tarballs representing a particular
version of a CRAN package and versions of its (recursive) dependencies
that were contemporary on the first or last day the specified package
version resided on CRAN
}
\note{
Some packages retain the same version on CRAN for long periods of
time. The cohort in the manifest represents a gross proxy for the cohort
used in conjunction within an analysis which used a the \code{vers} version
of the specified package. In general it will *not* perfectly recreate
the set of package versions originally used.
