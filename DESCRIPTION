Description: switchr provides an abstraction for managing, installing,
    and switching between sets of installed R packages. This allows users to
    maintain multiple package lbiraries simultaneously, e.g. to maintain
    strict, package-version-specific reproducibility of many analyses, or
    work within a devel/release paradigm.
